# van-crime
Vancouver crime data analysis for CMPT 733 project

This repository contains the datasets along with the data wrangling scripts used.

These scripts are not supposed to be run again, but are included as a way for the instructors to verify the work done.

# How to run demo
Issue the commands from the root of the repository:

cd src/
python run_demo.py

This will launch the live demo used during the poster presentation.

For a given Year, Month, Street number and Street name inside the City of Vancouver, the demo will present the predictions from the classification and regression models, as well as the expected number of crimes of each type fpr that locaction.
